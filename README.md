SICKEST CAR DASH - Domingo, Josh, Moe, Xavier

Using an ESP32 that is hooked up to the OBDII system of a car, we host a web server that communicates with external devices such as the Raspberry Pi for the dash and laptops, to enable data transfer and telemetry functionality.

The dash will run off a Raspberry Pi that has an OLED screen hooked up via SPI.

Insert more information later.
